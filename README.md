# 🎵 Data Sonification: Image to Sound

This repository demonstrates a creative data sonification pipeline that converts image data into sound by mapping pixel values to audio frequencies. It provides tools to transform images into NumPy arrays and mapping into frequency for sound wave production.

---

## 📁 Features

- Convert images to NumPy arrays
- Map pixel data to frequency ranges


---

## 🎯 Use Case

This project is ideal for:
- Artists experimenting with data-driven music
- Accessibility projects (visual-to-auditory translation)
- Educational tools in signal processing and AI
- Exploring pattern recognition through sound
